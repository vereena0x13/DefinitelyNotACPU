 - change the bit shift inputs from B to A so we don't have to copy A into B to shift it
 - remove the bitwise not function from the PLD logic
 - allow loading (and perhaps setting and clearing too, probably) the Z and C flags individually
    - Z flag should be touched by and, or, xor, but C shouldn't 
 - instead of having ucode_base and the ucode_xx files, let's just have one ucode file 
   and then generate it four times. we can pass in defines to customasm on the CLI to 
   specify the flags, and then just use #ifs. and then we just concatenate each output.
   not sure why i didn't think to do it that way originally lol
